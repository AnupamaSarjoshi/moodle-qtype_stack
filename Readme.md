# STACK 3.0

[STACK](doc/en/About/index.md) is an open-source system for computer-aided
assessment in Mathematics and related disciplines, with emphasis on formative
assessment.

STACK was created by [Chris Sangwin](http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/C.J.Sangwin/) of
the University of Birmingham, and includes the work of
[other contributors](doc/en/About/Credits.md).


## Warning

Stack 3.0 is currently under [active development](doc/en/Developer/Development_track.md).
It is not ready for real use, but please feel free to download it to try out.

It is now possible to install the question type, create and edit questions, and
preview them and use them in a quiz. There are, however, still many details to
get right.


## Documentation

The [documentation is here](doc/en/index.md), including the
