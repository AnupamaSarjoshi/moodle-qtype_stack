# STACK 4.2

[STACK](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/index.md) is an assessment system for mathematics, science and related disciplines.

STACK was created by [Chris Sangwin](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~csangwin/) of the University of Edinburgh, and includes the work of many [other contributors](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/Credits.md). A demonstration server is available in Edinburgh:  [https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo](https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo).

STACK is based on continuing research and use at the University of Edinburgh, the Open University, Aalto, Loughborough University, the University of Birmingham and others.

## Current state of development

STACK 4.2 contains some important new features, and a number of interface improvements and bug fixes.

**Note: please read the release notes before upgrading from STACK 3.X to STACK 4.X.  STACK 4.0 represents a major release of STACK and is a non-reversible change, with important differences which break back-compatability. Especially, note the [conversion of old materials](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Authoring/ImportExport.md#migrating-stack-3-questions-to-stack-4).**

Please continue to report any bugs you find at https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues.

The [current state of development](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Developer/Development_track.md) is explain more fully in the [developer documentation](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Developer/index.md).


## Documentation

The [documentation is here](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/index.md), including the [installation instructions](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Installation/index.md).


## Community
### Exchange of questions
There is a database of STACK-question at https://db.ak-mathe-digital.de/domain. Right now there are over 400 STACK-questions, in many different languages. A filter simplifies the search for specific questions. Questions can easily be exported as xml-files and as such can be used in moodle as well as in ILIAS. Everybody can contribute their own questions. 

### Meetings
The 1st international STACK Conference took place on the 15th and 16th of November 2018 in FÃ¼rth at the FAU. Further information and slides and at https://www.stack-konferenz.de/.
