# STACK 3.0

[STACK](https://github.com/sangwinc/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/index.md)
is an open-source system for computer-aided assessment in Mathematics and related
disciplines, with emphasis on formative assessment.

STACK was created by [Chris Sangwin](http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/C.J.Sangwin/) of
the University of Birmingham, and includes the work of
[other contributors](https://github.com/sangwinc/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/Credits.md).


## Warning

Stack 3.0 is currently under
[active development](https://github.com/sangwinc/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Developer/Development_track.md).
This code is intended only for use by developers, and early adopters wishing to help test the code.

It is now possible to install the question type, create and edit questions, and preview them and use them in a quiz. There are, however, still many details to get right.
