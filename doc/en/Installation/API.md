# API

This page documents the API to STACK questions.  Most users will include STACK as part of Moodle or ILIAS.  The API is designed to enable STACK questions to be included in stand-aline websites and other systems.  Incorporating STACK in other websites is a technical job for developers.

__The API is new in STACK 4.2.  These features of the codebase are subject to future change.  If you intend to make use of the API please alert the developers, and track changes in STACK.__

Notes

1. the API provides a stateless interface.  The question authoring, management and user data must be stored elsewhere.
2. installation instructions are included in `api/Readme.md`.
