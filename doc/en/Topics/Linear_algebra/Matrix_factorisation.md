# Matrix factorisation functions

STACK has a contributed library for matrix factorisation functions.  To use this library you must load it into the question variables.

* To use the latest code from github: `stack_include_contrib("matrixfactorization.mac");`
* Loading this library automatically declares `stack_linear_algebra_declare(true);` to provide context.

This page contains reference documentation on functions in this library.

TODO: document `matrixfactorization.mac`.
