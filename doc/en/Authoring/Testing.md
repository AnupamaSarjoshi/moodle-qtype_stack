# Testing

Computer aided assessment of mathematics works in the following phases.

1. [Authoring](../Authoring/)
2. [Testing](Testing.md)
3. [Deploying](Deploying.md)
4. [Reviewing](Reviewing.md)

## Testing for quality control  ##

It is important to test questions to ensure they work correctly.  One approach would be for the teacher
to repeatedly test them with various random numbers and inputs.  But this is inefficient and unreliable.

Question Tests provide an automated mechanism through which the author may establish with confidence that
the Potential Response Trees are processing the student answer as expected. This means they can adapt and
extend the question without fear of regression. Question variables can be included in the tests.

Each test assigns values to 

1. any/all of the inputs.  These values may, naturally, depend on the
   [question variables](KeyVals.md#Question_variables).
2. [Answer notes](Potential_response_trees.md#Answer_note) from each of
   the [potential response trees](Potential_response_trees.md).

When the teacher tries a question, STACK automatically takes each test, assigns the values
to inputs and attempts to submit it.  The results of the last answer note from
each potential response tree is compared to that specified by the teacher.

The teacher can also examine by hand the outcomes generated by each step of each test, including full feedback generated.

In this way, the teacher can record, within the question itself, how they expect the marking
scheme to work for a variety of student answers.

_Note_: currently (19/3/9) only the last Answer Note, not the whole path through the potential response
tree, is examined.  In future we envisage a mechanism which will allow much more specific testing to be automated.

_Note_: currently (19/3/9) the tests are not checked when an item is deployed.
