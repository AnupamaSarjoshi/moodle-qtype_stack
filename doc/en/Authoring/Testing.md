# Testing

Computer aided assessment of mathematics works in the following phases.

1. [Authoring](../Authoring/)
2. [Testing](Testing.md)
3. [Deploying](Deploying.md)
4. [Reviewing](Reviewing.md)

## Testing for quality control  ##

It is important to test questions to ensure they work correctly.  One approach would be for the teacher
to repeatedly test them with various random numbers and inputs.  But this is inefficient and unreliable.

Question Tests provide an automated mechanism through which the author may establish with confidence that
the Potential Response Trees are processing the student answer as expected. They are based on the concept of "unit testing" from software development.
Question variables can be included in the tests, indeed these are needed to define test inputs in the context of random values.

Each test assigns values to 

1. any/all of the inputs.  These values may, naturally, depend on the
   [question variables](KeyVals.md#Question_variables).
2. [Answer notes](Potential_response_trees.md#Answer_note) from each of
   the [potential response trees](Potential_response_trees.md).

The teacher can opt to run the question tests from the preview window.  STACK automatically takes each test, assigns the values
to inputs and attempts to submit it.  The results of the last answer note from
each potential response tree is compared to that specified by the teacher.  Notice this is a limitation of the system.  Specifying the complete route through the potential response tree would be too difficult and would discourage teachers from writing tests.

The teacher can also examine by hand the outcomes generated by each step of each test, including full feedback generated.

In this way, the teacher can record, within the question itself, how they expect the marking scheme to work for a variety of student answers.

_Note_: currently only the last Answer Note, not the whole path through the potential response tree, is examined.
