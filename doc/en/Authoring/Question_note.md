# Question note

The question note is [CASText](CASText.md).

_Two question versions are equal if and only if the question notes are equal._

The purpose of a question note is to distinguish between random versions of a question.  In particular, when we generate statisticts about students' attempts we group attempts according to the equality of their question notes.
Two versions are not necessarily different if their [question variables](KeyVals.md#Question_variables)
are different, and hence a note is useful.  The teacher needs to choose what identifies each unique version - this cannot be automated.

The teacher can also leave useful information about the answer in the question note.
For example they might use
	
	\[ \frac{d}{d@v@}@p@ = @diff(p,v)@ \]
