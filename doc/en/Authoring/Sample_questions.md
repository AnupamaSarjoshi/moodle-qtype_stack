# Sample Questions

STACK is distributed with sample questions in

     /qtype_stack/samplequestions/

The sample questions are in English.

We would encourage colleagues to release their materials under a creative commons licence.

### `tangent-line.xml` ###

This question asks students to find the line tangent to a randomly generated cubic polynomial at a point.  It is broken down into three parts to provide structure.  This randomly generated three part question has follow through marking.  Details of how to write this question are given in the the section on [multi-part mathematical questions](Multi-part_mathematical_questions.md).

### `cubic-spline.xml` ###

In this question a student is asked to find a cubic spline.  This question illustrates the following.

* Separate properties are established, i.e. the answer is a cubic, has the right end point values and correct derivatives at the end points.
* Plots are incorporated, including a plot of a student's incorrect answer.

### `odd-even.xml` ###

In this question a student is asked to give examples of odd and even functions.

* There are four separate parts.  Separate properties are established by each.
* For two of the parts there are non-unique correct answers.
* Feedback based on calculations of students' answers is included.

### Open Educational Resources ###

The FETLAR project released a large collection of STACK 2 questions in English covering calculus and algebra
in April 2010.  

* Questions to cover all parts of the [The Map of Algebraic Manipulation](http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/staff/ad_barnard/Pocket.pdf).  
* Questions to cover all of the [Calculus Refresher](http://www.mathcentre.ac.uk/resources/exercisebooks/mathcentre/final0502-calc-ref-ukmlsc.pdf) by Dr Tony Croft and Dr Anthony Kay.

We plan to convert these into STACK 3 format and add them to the distribution in due course.
