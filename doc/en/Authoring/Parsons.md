# Authoring Parson's problem blocks

Parsonâ€™s problems require students to assemble pre-written text into a correct order by dragging blocks into a tree structure.  This block is needed to hold the javascript and strings which students can drag.

STACK provides a `[[parsons]] ... [[/ parsons]]` [question block](Question_blocks/index.md).  The question author pre-defines strings.  These strings can be defined as Maxima variables in the question text, or just defined within the question block itself.

Users interact with the strings, dragging them into a tree structure.  Note, a list is a special case of a more structured tree.  The block can be linked to a STACK input so that the student's configuration can be stored and/or assessed.  This page is reference documentation for the `[[parsons]]` block.  Documentation on how to use this block in a complete question is given under topics: [Authoring Parson's problems](../Topics/Parsons.md).

## Authoring JSON within the question text itself.

Here is a basic example of use:

````
[[ parsons input="ans1" ]]
{ 
  "1":"Assume that \\(n\\) is odd.",
  "2":"Then there exists an \\(m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(n=2m+1\\).",
  "3":"\\[ n^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 2(2m^2+2m)+1.\\]\",
  "4":"Define \\(M=2m^2+2m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) then \\(n^2=2M+1\\).",
}
[[/ parsons ]]
````

Assume the question author writes a list of strings in Maxima, `proof_steps` in the question variables with both the correct and incorrect strings.

````
[[ parsons input="ans1" ]]
{# stackjson_stringify(proof_steps) #}
[[/ parsons ]]
````

or they can avoid strings going via Maimxa at all by writing JSON directly

Both these approaches can be combined

````
[[ parsons input="ans1" ]]
{ 
  "1":{#proof_steps[1]#},
  "2":"Then there exists an \\(m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(n=2m+1\\).",
  "3":"\\[ n^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 2(2m^2+2m)+1.\\]\",
  "4":"Define \\(M=2m^2+2m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) then \\(n^2=2M+1\\).",
}
[[/ parsons ]]
````

## Adding `Sortable.js` options to the `[[parsons]]` block

The `[[parsons]]` block is a wrapper for the Javascript library "Sortable.js", optimised and with default options for Parson's problems.  As such, there are a very wide range of options for this javascript library.  These options are all passed into the block as a JSON string.   To do this we separate out the arguments to the block into separate "steps" and "options" fields. 

````
[[ parsons input="ans1" ]]
{ "steps": {{# stackjson_stringify(proof_steps) #}},
  "options": {....}
}
[[/ parsons ]]
````

The Parson's drag and drop lists are created using the Sortable JavaScript library. These lists come with their own set of [options](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable#options), currently these are set at the default option for `"animation"` which controls the animation speed.

````
{
    "animation": 50,
}
````

Most Sortable options can be toggled by passing a JSON that is structured as follows in the Parson's block:

````
[[ parsons input="ans1" height="360px" width="100%"]]
{
    "steps": { 
        "1":"Assume that \\(n\\) is odd.",
        "2":"Then there exists an \\(m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(n=2m+1\\).",
        "3":"\\[ n^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 2(2m^2+2m)+1.\\]",
        "4":"Define \\(M=2m^2+2m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) then \\(n^2=2M+1\\).",
        "5": "Assume that \\(n\\) is even.",
        "6": "Then there exists an \\(m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(n = 2m\\)."
    },
    "options": {
        "animation" : 150,
    }
}
[[/parsons]]
````
However, note that some options cannot be toggled as they are required for the proper functioning of the Sortable lists. Hence, any user-defined options for `ghostClass` and `group` are overwritten.

The default options are TODO: confirm the above syntax and the default options!

## Block paramaters

1. Parameter `state` gives the tree built up from the keys from which the applet should be initialised.
2. The applet returns up updated state (indentical format: maxima expression) for evaluation by a PRT.  This is linked to an input with parameter `input=`.
3. `height` and `width` paramaters exist.  TODO: examples/specs.

## Random generation of `proof_step` order

To track which random variants of a question a student sees, and make sure they return to the same varient, we need to perform all randomisation at the Maxima level.

You must define steps as Maxima objects using a `proof_steps` list (see the documentation of for [CAS libraries for representing text-based proofs](../Proof/Proof_CAS_libraries.md)) then you can randomly order the `proof_steps` as follows.

1. Define `proof_steps` as normal.
2. Add in `proof_steps:random_permutation(proof_steps);` to the question variables.
3. Add in a question note `{@map(first, proof_steps)@}` to create a meaningful, minimal, question note giving the order of steps.

Note, if you randomly generate random variants it is _strongly recommended_ you use text-based keys.  Keeping track of permuted numerical keys will be impossible!

## Block connection with Maxima

All communication to and from the Parsons block uses the JSON format.  However, internally STACK uses maxima objets.  We therefore need to convert between Maxima syntax and JSON format.

1. The maxima function `stackjson_stringify(proof_steps)` will convert a list of `proof_steps` into a JSON string.
2. The maxima function `proof_parsons_interpret(ans1)` will convert a JSON string into a [proof construction function](../Proof/Proof_CAS_library.md).
3. The maxima function `proof_parsons_key_json(ta, proof_steps)` takes the teacher's answer `ta` and a list of proof steps `proof_steps` and creates a JSON string which represents `ta` and lists any available (unused) strings from the `proof_steps` list.  This function is needed to set up the "model answer" field in the inputs from a maxima representation of the proof.

### Block paramaters: `height` and `width`

Additional display options including `height` and `width` may also be passed to the header, as in 

````
[[ parsons input="ans1" height="360px" width="100%"]]
{ 
  "1":"Assume that \\(n\\) is odd.",
  "2":"Then there exists an \\(m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(n=2m+1\\).",
  "3":"\\[ n^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 2(2m^2+2m)+1.\\]",
  "4":"Define \\(M=2m^2+2m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) then \\(n^2=2M+1\\).",
  "5": "Assume that \\(n\\) is even.",
  "6": "Then there exists an \\(m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(n = 2m\\)."
};
[[/parsons]]

## Adding plots to a Parson's block

Since HTML can be embedded into strings dragged within a Parson's block, images can be included with the HTML `<img>` tags as normal.

STACK-generated [plots](../Plots/index.md) cannot be included just using `{@plot(x^2,[x,-1,1])@}` as might be expected.  This is because of the _order_ of evaluation.  The full URL of the image is only created in the (complex) chain of events after the value has been substituted into the Javascript code. Instead, to embed STACK-generated images evaluate a static string using the Maxima `castext` function, and then use the value of `s1` in the Parson's block.  For example.

    s1:castext("{@plot(x^2,[x,-1,1],[size,250,250])@}");
