# Author quick start 1: a minimal working question


The author quick start guide shows you how to write STACK questions.  Part 1 gets a minimal question working.

Consider students who are learning to symbolically integrate expressions of the form \( r(px+q)^n \). Below is a typical set of practice exercises.

At the end of this guide you will be able to:

- Create a new STACK question, ensuring mathematical notation is displayed correctly using \(\LaTeX\) notation.
- Catch, and provide feedback on, common errors by building a *Potential Response Tree*. These include forgetting to include the constant of integration or accidentally differentiating instead of integrating.
- Create random versions, and ensure the marking algorithms, feedback and worked solutions reflect this.
- Preview and test STACK questions.

## Before you begin

We assume you are familiar with the following:

1. Adding questions to a Moodle quiz, via the [question bank](MoodleQuiz.md).
2. Simple \(\LaTeX\) formatting for mathematics.  Some basic examples are provided at the end of the [CASText](CASText.md) documentation.  The full document preparation system is not needed or supported.
3. Using a strict syntax for representing mathematical expressions, e.g. `1/2*sin(n*pi)`.  Knowing about the computer algebra system (CAS) [Maxima](%CONTENT/minimal-maxima.pdf) would be useful in the longer term, but this introduction is self-contained.

## Creating a minimal STACK question

Navigate to the [question bank](MoodleQuiz.md) and create a new question.

There are lots of fields, but only a few are compulsory.

1. The question name.
2. The question shown to the student.
3. The teacher's answer.
4. A test of "correctness".

By default a new question automatically has one [input](Inputs.md), and one algorithm to test correctness of the answer.

### Question name ###

You must give the question a name. Use something meaningful so that you can easily identify it later.  For example `question1`.

### Question text ###

Next we need to write the question text itself. Copy the following into the Question text box:

    Find \(\int 5(3x-2)^{-3} \mathrm{d}x\).

    [[input:ans1]] [[validation:ans1]]

Notes:

* Moodle has a wide choice for text editors, so the screenshots in this quickstart guide migth look slightly different to your version of Moodle.
* The text contains LaTeX mathematics environments.  Do not use mathematics environments `$..$` and `$$..$$`.  Instead you must use `\(..\)` and `\[..]\` for inline and displayed mathematics respectively.  (There is an automatic bulk converter if you have a lot of legacy materials.)
* The tag `[[input:ans1]]` denotes the position of the box into which the student puts their answer.
* The tag `[[validation:ans1]]` will be replaced by any feedback related to the validity of the input `ans1`.  E.g. syntax errors caused by missing brackets.
* The tags could be positioned anywhere in the question text: more on this later.
* Internally the student's answer will be assigned to a variable `ans1`.

## Input: ans1

Scroll down:  there will be an [inputs](Inputs.md) section of the editing form.  Click on the heading `Input: ans1` to reveal the relevant settings.

For a minimal question we must specify the _model answer_ field.

    −5/(6*(3*x−2)^2)+c

![Model answer](%CONTENT/model_answer.png)

Notes

1. The student's response is stored in the answer variable `ans1`.
2. The model answer must be a syntactically valid CAS expression, not LaTeX.  E.g. `−5/(6*(3*x−2)^2)+c` not `\frac{-5}{6(3x-2)^2}+c`.
3. [Inputs](Inputs.md) can have a variety of forms selected by the  _Input type_ drop-down menu.  The _Algebraic input_ is default, and what we need here.
4. A question can have many inputs for multiple parts.  These are discussed later in this guide.

## Assessing correctness of a response - the Potential Response Tree (PRT)

Next we have to decide if the student's answer is correct.

To grade the student's response we need to determine its mathematical properties using an algorithm known as a [potential response tree](Potential_response_trees.md).

By default, a new question contains one [potential response tree](Potential_response_trees.md) called `prt1`.  Feedback generated by the tree replaces the tag `[[feedback:prt1]]` at the appropriate time.

### Configuring a potential response node

A potential response tree is a non-empty acyclic directed graph of _potential response nodes_.  By default we have one potential response node.

1. `SAns` is compared to `TAns` with the answer test, possibly with an option.
2. If `true` then we execute the `true` branch.
3. If `false` then we execute the `false` branch.

Each branch can then

* Assign/update the score.
* Assign formative [feedback](Feedback.md) to the student.
* Leave an [answer note](Potential_response_trees.md#Answer_note) for [reporting](Reporting.md) purposes.
* Nominate the next potential response node, or end the process `[stop]`.

Let us configure the first node to determine if the student has integrated correctly.

1. Specify the variable `ans1` in the `SAns` setting.
2. Specify the correct answer in the `TAns` setting: `−5/(6*(3*x−2)^2)+c`
3. Confirm we have `AlgEquiv` in the _Answer test_ drop-down menu (this is the default).

The node should now be configured as follows:

![Configured PRT node](%CONTENT/configured_node.png)

## Saving the question

Now scroll to the bottom of the page and press the `[Save changes and continue editing]` button.  If the question fails to save check carefully for any errors, correct them and save again.

__We now have a minimal question.__

To recap we have

1. The question name.
2. The question shown to the student.
3. The teacher's answer.
4. A test of "correctness".

Next we should try out our question, by pressing the preview button at the bottom of the page:

![Preview button](%CONTENT/preview_button.png)

## Previewing the question

To speed up the testing process, scroll down the preview window and under Attempt options, make sure you have "How questions behave" set to "Adaptive Mode". If necessary "Start again with these options". This will allow you to check your answers without having to _Submit_ and _Start again_ repeatedly.

With the preview open, try typing in

    -5/6(3*x-2)^-2 + c

into the answer box. The system first establishes the syntactical validity of this answer.

Press the `[Check]` button.

The system executes the potential response tree and establishes whether your answer is equivalent
to the model answer `-5/6(3*x-2)^-2+c`.

Next type in `-5/6(3*x-2)^-2 + C`.  Now, if we compare the teacher's `-5/6(3*x-2)^-2+c` with `-5/6(3*x-2)^-2 + C` using algebraic equivalence (recal we specified `AlgEquiv` in the potential response tree).  This will not work.

We need to edit the question now to use a different answer test...  [TODO]

Next, try getting the question wrong.  If your server does not have "instant validation" switched on (an administrator/installation option) you will need to submit each answer twice.
Notice all your responses are stored in an attempts table.

To demonstrate that it's the mathematical properties of the student's response that is being compared type

    -5/6(3*x-2)^-2 + K

into the answer box.

I am including a constant of integration (as I specified) so this is, again, correct.

Built into the _Int_ answer test is a check to ensure the response includes a constant of integration. Now type

    -5/6(3*x-2)^-2

into the answer box.

We also wanted to check that the student hadn't differentiated by mistake. Fortunately this is also handled by the _Int_ answer test. Finally, type

    -45*(3*x-2)^-4

See that built-in feedback is provided to the student - a warning that they have forgotten the constant of integration. Again, this can be disabled with the _Quiet_ option. 


## Using question variables

The model answer will normally be referred to more than once, so it is usually easiest to assign the model answer to a variable using the optional [question variables](KeyVals.md#Question_variables) field.

Add the following to the question variables

    p: 5*(3*x-2)^-3;
    ta: int(p,x)+c;

STACK uses Maxima's syntax for assignment, which is unusual.  In particular the colon `:` is used to assign a value to a variable.  So to assign the value of `5` to `n` we use the syntax `n:5`.

Notice we are using the CAS to determine the model answer by calling the `int()` function to find the anti-derivative. When the CAS determines an anti-derivative it does not include a constant of integration so we have to add it ourselves 

Now we need to update the rest of the question to use the variables. Replace the question text with

    Find \(\int{@p@}\mathrm{dx}\)
    [[input:ans1]] [[validation:ans1]]

Notice that now we have defined a local variable `p`, and used the value of this in the Question text.  The difference is between mathematics enclosed between `\(..\)` symbols and `{@..@}` symbols. All the text-based fields in the question, including feedback, are [CAS text](CASText.md).  This is HTML into which mathematics can be inserted.  LaTeX is placed between `\(..\)`s, and CAS expressions (including your variables) between matching `{@..@}` symbols.  The CAS expressions are evaluated in the context of the question variables and displayed.

Since we have used `{@p@}` here, the user will not see a \(p\) on the screen when the question is instantiated, but the _displayed value_ of `p`.

In the input `ans1` replace the _model answer_ with `ta`.

In the potential response tree, node 1, replace the expression `SAns` with `ta`.

These change just propogate the new variables throught out the question.  We should test the question again, but this can be done in an automatic way.

## Question tests ##

Testing questions is time consuming and tedious, but important to ensure questions work.  To help with this process STACK enables teachers to define "question tests".  These are the same principle as "unit tests" in software engineering.

From the question preview window, click on `Question tests & deployed versions` link in the top right of the page.

Please read the page on [testing](Testing.md).

Please ensure you have deleted the third node from the potential response tree!  Click `Add a test case` to add a test to your question.  Fill in the following information

    ans1 = ta
    score = 1
    penalty = 0
    answernote = prt1-1-T

The system will automatically evaluate `ta` to create `ans1` and then mark the question using this information.  It will match up the actual outcomes with those you specified.  This automates the testing process.

You can add as many tests as you think is needed, and it is usually a sensible idea to add one for each case you anticipate.  Add in another test case for

    ans1 = ev(int(p,x),simp)
    score = 0
    penalty = 0.1
    answernote = prt1-1-F

Here we create a test case without a constant of integration.  This should fail!

## Back to the mathematics!

So far we have authored question (i) from the text book, shown in the image above:
\(
\int \frac{5}{(3x - 2)^3} \mathrm{d}x
\)

Below is a student's written response, which demonstrates two common slips:

![Student written response](%CONTENT/student_written_response.png)

Notice that the student has:

- Forgotten to include the constant of integration.
- Differentiated the outer function, instead of integrating.

Of course, these are things which students are likley to do with any integration question.  Indeed, through force of habit students have been known to differentiate by mistake and still add a constant of integration!  Also, there are mistakes students have made which are much more specific to this particular question:

- Forgetting to use substitution and hence not dividing by \(p\), and effectively integrating \( \int r(px+q)^n \mathrm{d}x \rightarrow \frac{r}{n+1}(px+q)^{n+1}+c \).
- having difficulties in increasing a negative number (in this case \(-3\) by one).  In our example \( \int \frac{5}{(3x - 2)^3} \mathrm{d}x \rightarrow \frac{5}{3}\frac{1}{(3x - 2)^4}+c\).

__The whole point of STACK is that the CAS enables teachers to check for these kinds of errors and provide students with meaningful feedback which helps them improve their performance, without using multiple choice options which give the game away!__

When checking a student's answer with STACK a teacher needs to ask themselves _"What are the mathematical properties which makes a student's answer correct/incorrect?"_  In our case these questions include:

- Is the student's answer a symbolic anti-derivative of the integrand?
- Does the student have a constant of integration in an appropriate form?

Next, a teacher needs to ask _"What might a student do incorrectly, and what will this give them as an answer?"_  This second question is more difficult. The answer might come through experience or from asking upfront diagnostic questions (again using STACK). It is often sensible to review questions after a year and build in better feedback in the light of experience with students. 

## Enhancing student feedback

There are two further common mistakes for students to make when finding the anti-derivative of simple functions-of-functions:

1. Accidentally finding the derivative of the outer function (multiplying by the power and taking one off the power - i.e. following the wrong process).
2. Expanding brackets when they didn't need to - not remembering to leave their final answer in factored form. 

### Catching a common slip: following the wrong process ###

Let us continue to enhance feedback by checking that the student has not differentiated the outer function by mistake. We do this by adding another potential response node.

Close the preview, scroll down to the Potential Response Tree and click `[Add another node]` button at the bottom of the list of nodes:

![Adding a new node](%CONTENT/add_new_node.png)

From the false branch of Node 1, change the "Next" field so it is set to `[Node 2]`.
If the first test is false, we will then perform the test in Node 2.

Update the form so that Node 2 has

    SAns = diff(ans1, x)
    TAns = 60*(3*x-2)^-5
    Answer test = AlgEquiv

See that we are using Maxima to differentiate the student's answer. We then compare that result, algebraically, to what the question would have been for the student to respond in the way they have.

This gives us the test, but what about the outcomes?

1. On the true branch set the `score=0`
2. On the true branch set the feedback to `It looks like you have subtracted one off the power of the outer function instead of adding one to the power!`

Notice here that STACK also adds an "intelligent note to self" in the [answer note](Potential_response_trees.md#Answer_note) field:

![Answer note](%CONTENT/answer_node.png)

This is useful for statistical grouping of similar outcomes when the feedback depends on randomly generated questions,
and different responses. You have something definite to group over.  This is discussed in [reporting](Reporting.md).

Press the `[Save changes and continue editing]` button and preview the question.

Type the following response into the answer box:

    -5/12*(3*x-2)^-4+C

Because we are using Maxima to differentiate the student's response, whether or not the student includes a constant of integration in their answer. You can verify this by typing the above response but missing off the constant.

### The Form of a Response: not leaving an answer in factored form

Because we are using the mathematical properties of a student's response to judge its accuracy, we can even check to ensure that the student has responded in the correct form. For example, to answer our question a student answering this correctly is likely to respond with \(-\frac{5}{6}(3x-2)^{-2} + C \) but they might equally well respond with \( -\frac{5}{54x^{2}-72x+24} + C\). This is, of course, mathematically correct but not in the factored form convention demands. The student is correct but we still should guide them towards not expanding brackets when they don't need to. 

We need to go back and `[Add another node]` to the Potential Response Tree. A third node is added.

To use this potential response, edit Node 1, and now change the true branch to make the Next node point to the new Node 3.
If we enter Node 3, we know the student has the correct answer and just need to establish if it is factored or not and provide the appropriate feedback. To establish this we need to use the [FacForm answer test](Answer_tests.md).

Update the form so that Node 3 has

    SAns = diif(ans1)
    TAns = -5/6(3*x-2)^-2 + C
    Answer test = FacForm
    Test options = x
    Quiet = Yes.

The FacForm answer test provides automatic feedback which would be inappropriate here, hence we choose the quiet option.

We also need to assign outcomes.

1. On the true branch set the `score=1`
2. On the false branch set the `score=1`
3. On the false branch set the feedback to `Your answer is not factored. Well done for getting the correct answer but remember that there is no need to expand out the brackets.`

Having developed our integration question to the point where we can provide some quite detailed guidance to students (based on the mathematical properties of their answer) we can now consider using this particular question as the basis for a whole set of random questions.

Before moving on you might consider saving the current question as a new question so you don't lose your work.

# Random questions ##

To generate random questions we again make use of the [question variables](KeyVals.md#Question_variables) field.

Right at the very start of this guide we introduced the idea of question variables. Let's take a look again the the question variables we declared:

<textarea readonly="readonly" rows="2" cols="50">
definition:5*(3*x-2)^-3
model: integrate(definition, x)+C
</textarea>

We defined two local variables `definition` and `model`, and used these values in both the Question text and in the potential response tree. 

In the question text we entered the following:

<textarea readonly="readonly" rows="3" cols="50">
Find \(\int{@definition@}\mathrm{d}x\)
[[input:ans1]] [[validation:ans1]]
</textarea>

The difference is between mathematics enclosed between `\(..\)` symbols and `{@..@}` symbols. All the text-based fields in the question, including feedback, are [CAS text](CASText.md).  This is HTML into which mathematics can be inserted.  \(\LaTeX\) is placed between `\(..\)`s, and CAS expressions (including your variables) between matching `{@..@}` symbols.  There is more information in the specific documentation.   

Notice also that in the model answer there is a CAS command to integrate the value of `definition` with respect to `x`. It wasn't necessary for the CAS to work out the answer to our original question (we could have specified it ourselves) but it is certainly necessary in a random question.

We are now in a position to generate a random question. To do this modify the [question variables](KeyVals.md#Question_variables) to be

    a : 1+rand(6)
    b : 1+rand(6)
    c : 1+rand(6)
    n : -1-rand(6)
    definition : a(b*x-c)^n;
    model: integrate(definition, x)+C

In this new question we are asking the student to find the anti-derivative of a question with a definite form \(\frac{a}{(b*x-c)^n}\). `a`, `b`, `c` and `n` are all variables, which are assigned random numbers. These are then used to define the variable `definition`, used in the question itself. We also have the CAS integrate the definition and store the result in the variable `model`.

Remember that when generating random questions in STACK then we talk about _random numbers_ when we really mean _pseudo-random numbers_. To keep track of which random numbers are generated for each user, there is a special `rand` command in STACK,
which you should use instead of [Maxima](../CAS/Maxima.md)'s random command. The `rand` command is a general "random thing" generator, see the page on [random generation](../CAS/Random.md) for full details. Not only can it can be used to generate random numbers and also to make selections from a list (discussed later in this guide).

### Question note ###

Now that our question contains random numbers we need to record the actual question (i.e. so that we know what was actually asked). As soon as we use the `rand` function STACK forces us to add a _Question note_. For our new, randomised integration question fill this in as

    Find \[\int{@definition@}\mathrm{d}x\]


### Handling random variables in the Potential Response Tree ###

We also need to ensure the test answers, `TAns`, in each node of the potential response tree are updated accordingly. If the student has differentiated the outer function by mistake then the derivative of their response will be of the form:

    \[n*(n-1)*a*(b*x-c)^{n-2}\]
    
We are already using the `definition` and `model` variables in both the integration and factor form tests we configured earlier so these can stay unchanged.

Edit your trial question, save and preview it to get new random versions of the question.

### Futher randomisation ###

The `rand` function can also be used to select items from a list. For example, we can use random selection from a list to vary our integration question even further:

    a : 1+rand(6);
    b : 1+rand(6);
    c : 1+rand(6);
    sign: rand[-1,1];
    n : rand(6)*sign;
    definition : a(b*x-c)^n;
    model: integrate(definition, x)+C;

As questions become increasingly complex, it is a good habit to comment complicated lines in the Maxima code in the Question variables and Feedback variables, in order to make the code easier to read for anyone wishing to edit the question. Comments are entered as follows: `sign: rand[-1,1]; /* The power is randomly set to either positive or negative */`.

# Next steps #

You might like to look at Moodle's quiz settings, creating a simple quiz.  This is, strictly speaking, a completely Moodle issue and there is every reason to combine STACK questions with other Moodle question types.  Some very brief notes are included in the [quiz quickstart guide](Authoring_quick_start_quiz.md).

STACK's question type is very flexible.

* You can add a worked solution in the [General feedback](CASText.md#General_feedback).
* You can change the behaviour of the question with the [options](Options.md)
* You can add plots to all the [CASText](CASText.md) fields with the [`plot`](../CAS/Maxima.md#plot) command.
* You can add support for [multiple languages](Languages.md).

The next part of the authoring quick start guide looks at [multi-part mathematical questions](Authoring_quick_start_2.md).
