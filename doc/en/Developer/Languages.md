# Translation of the STACK Project

STACK 2 was distributed in the following languages.  We intend these to be updated for STACK 3.

  * DE: German, by Frank Schütte
  * EN: English (British), by Chris Sangwin
  * NL: Dutch, by Tim Neijens

STACK is designed to support the straightforward addition of other language packs.
If you have translated STACK into other languages - or would be interested in doing so - please let us know.

We will maintain this page to indicate which languages are being worked on or have been requested.

# Multilingual materials.

Colleagues have asked for multilingual materials.  We plan to implement this using Moodle's Multi-language content filter, see 
[http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Multi-language_content_filter](http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Multi-language_content_filter).
